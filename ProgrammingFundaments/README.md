Overview

This module reviews the programming fundamentals in Python covered in the previous Python programming courses. In particular, this module will highlight lists, dictionaries, functions, and matplotlib in addition to the basic programming topics, such as input/output, conditionals, loops, and other foundational topics. We will write programs to simulate probability concepts, conduct regression analysis, and create data visualizations (bar charts and scatterplots) that you will have covered in your previous data science/statistics courses. The module will also introduce the seaborn visualization library that uses matplotlib. 
Learning Objectives

By the end of course, you will be able to:

    CO1: Identify industry-standard approaches to organization, storage, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of big data
    CO2: Wrangle raw data from different sources and formats
    CO3: Write data science programs in Python through an object-oriented approach using common data science packages
    CO4: Analyze data and results through statistical and visual analysis
    CO5: Investigate data science problems involving big data

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

    MO-1.1 Implement basic programming concepts in Python, including functions, lists, and dictionaries (supports CO3)
    MO 1.2 Write programs to simulate probability concepts (supports CO3, CO4)
    MO 1.3 Plot data in a bar chart with seaborn and matplotlib packages (supports CO1, CO3, CO4)
    MO 1.4 Interpret findings from simulation outcomes in Juypter Notebook (supports CO4, CO5)
