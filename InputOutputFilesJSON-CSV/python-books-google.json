        "description": "Unleash the power of Python 3 objectsAbout This Book• Stop writing scripts and start architecting programs• Learn the latest Python syntax and libraries• A practical, hands-on tutorial that teaches you all about abstract design patterns and how to implement them in Python 3Who This Book Is ForIf you're new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn in depth how and when to correctly apply object-oriented programming in Python to design software, this is the book for you.What You Will Learn• Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods• Separate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface• Extend class functionality using inheritance• Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them• Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python• Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python• Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3• Exploit object-oriented programming in key Python technologies such as Kivy and Django.• Object-oriented programming concurrently with asyncioIn DetailPython 3 is more versatile and easier to use than ever. It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception.Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.Style and approachThroughout the book you will learn key object-oriented programming techniques demonstrated by comprehensive case studies in the context of a larger project.",

        "description": "Practical Numerical and Scientific Computing with MATLAB(R) and Python concentrates on the practical aspects of numerical analysis and linear and non-linear programming. It discusses the methods for solving different types of mathematical problems using MATLAB and Python. Although the book focuses on the approximation problem rather than on error analysis of mathematical problems, it provides practical ways to calculate errors. The book is divided into three parts, covering topics in numerical linear algebra, methods of interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, solutions of differential equations, linear and non-linear programming problems, and optimal control problems. This book has the following advantages: It adopts the programming languages, MATLAB and Python, which are widely used among academics, scientists, and engineers, for ease of use and contain many libraries covering many scientific and engineering fields. It contains topics that are rarely found in other numerical analysis books, such as ill-conditioned linear systems and methods of regularization to stabilize their solutions, nonstandard finite differences methods for solutions of ordinary differential equations, and the computations of the optimal controls. It provides a practical explanation of how to apply these topics using MATLAB and Python. It discusses software libraries to solve mathematical problems, such as software Gekko, pulp, and pyomo. These libraries use Python for solutions to differential equations and static and dynamic optimization problems. Most programs in the book can be applied in versions prior to MATLAB 2017b and Python 3.7.4 without the need to modify these programs. This book is aimed at newcomers and middle-level students, as well as members of the scientific community who are interested in solving math problems using MATLAB or Python.",

        "description": "The book begins with the very foundations of OOP and then uses practical examples to show how to correctly implement Object Oriented Programming in Python. Many examples are taken from real-world projects. The book focuses on high-level design as well as the gritty details of the Python syntax. The provided exercises inspire the reader to think about his or her own code, rather than providing solved problems. If you're new to Object Oriented Programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn in depth how and when to correctly apply Object Oriented Programming in Python, this is the book for you. If you are an object-oriented programmer for other languages, you too will find this book a useful introduction to Python, as it uses terminology you are already familiar with. Python 2 programmers seeking a leg up in the new world of Python 3 will also find the book beneficial, and you need not necessarily know Python 2.",

        "description": "Master probabilistic graphical models by learning through real-world problems and illustrative code examples in PythonAbout This Book- Gain in-depth knowledge of Probabilistic Graphical Models- Model time-series problems using Dynamic Bayesian Networks- A practical guide to help you apply PGMs to real-world problemsIn DetailProbabilistic Graphical Models is a technique in machine learning that uses the concepts of graph theory to compactly represent and optimally predict values in our data problems. In real world problems, it's often difficult to select the appropriate graphical model as well as the appropriate inference algorithm, which can make a huge difference in computation time and accuracy. Thus, it is crucial to know the working details of these algorithms.This book starts with the basics of probability theory and graph theory, then goes on to discuss various models and inference algorithms. All the different types of models are discussed along with code examples to create and modify them, and also to run different inference algorithms on them. There is a complete chapter devoted to the most widely used networks Naive Bayes Model and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). These models have been thoroughly discussed using real-world examples.What You Will Learn- Get to know the basics of Probability theory and Graph Theory- Work with Markov Networks- Implement Bayesian Networks- Exact Inference Techniques in Graphical Models such as the Variable Elimination Algorithm- Understand approximate Inference Techniques in Graphical Models such as Message Passing Algorithms- Sample algorithms in Graphical Models- Grasp details of Naive Bayes with real-world examples- Deploy PGMs using various libraries in Python- Gain working details of Hidden Markov Models with real-world examples Who This Book Is ForIf you are a researcher or a machine learning enthusiast, or are working in the data science field and have a basic idea of Bayesian Learning or Probabilistic Graphical Models, this book will help you to understand the details of Graphical Models and use it in your data science problems. This book will also help you select the appropriate model as well as the appropriate algorithm for your problem.Style and approachAn easy-to-follow guide to help you understand Probabilistic Graphical Models using simple examples and numerous code examples, with an emphasis on more widely used models.",

        "description": "This innovative study presents concepts and problems in soil physics, and provides solutions using original computer programs. It provides a close examination of physical environments of soil, including an analysis of the movement of heat, water and gases. The authors employ the programming language Python, which is now widely used for numerical problem solving in the sciences. In contrast to the majority of the literature on soil physics, this text focuses on solving, not deriving, differential equations for transport. Using numerical procedures to solve differential equations allows the solution of quite difficult problems with fairly simple mathematical tools. Numerical methods convert differential into algebraic equations, which can be solved using conventional methods of linear algebra. Each chapter introduces a soil physics concept, and proceeds to develop computer programs to solve the equations and illustrate the points made in the discussion. Problems at the end of each chapter help the reader practise using the concepts introduced. The text is suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduates and researchers of soil physics. It employs an open source philosophy where computer code is presented, explained and discussed, and provides the reader with a full understanding of the solutions. Once mastered, the code can be adapted and expanded for the user's own models, fostering further developments. The Python tools provide a simple syntax, Object Oriented Programming techniques, powerful mathematical and numerical tools, and a user friendly environment.",

        "description": "Construct, analyze, and visualize networks with networkx, a Python language module. Network analysis is a powerful tool you can apply to a multitude of datasets and situations. Discover how to work with all kinds of networks, including social, product, temporal, spatial, and semantic networks. Convert almost any real-world data into a complex network--such as recommendations on co-using cosmetic products, muddy hedge fund connections, and online friendships. Analyze and visualize the network, and make business decisions based on your analysis. If you're a curious Python programmer, a data scientist, or a CNA specialist interested in mechanizing mundane tasks, you'll increase your productivity exponentially. Complex network analysis used to be done by hand or with non-programmable network analysis tools, but not anymore! You can now automate and program these tasks in Python. Complex networks are collections of connected items, words, concepts, or people. By exploring their structure and individual elements, we can learn about their meaning, evolution, and resilience. Starting with simple networks, convert real-life and synthetic network graphs into networkx data structures. Look at more sophisticated networks and learn more powerful machinery to handle centrality calculation, blockmodeling, and clique and community detection. Get familiar with presentation-quality network visualization tools, both programmable and interactive--such as Gephi, a CNA explorer. Adapt the patterns from the case studies to your problems. Explore big networks with NetworKit, a high-performance networkx substitute. Each part in the book gives you an overview of a class of networks, includes a practical study of networkx functions and techniques, and concludes with case studies from various fields, including social networking, anthropology, marketing, and sports analytics. Combine your CNA and Python programming skills to become a better network analyst, a more accomplished data scientist, and a more versatile programmer. What You Need: You will need a Python 3.x installation with the following additional modules: Pandas (\u003e=0.18), NumPy (\u003e=1.10), matplotlib (\u003e=1.5), networkx (\u003e=1.11), python-louvain (\u003e=0.5), NetworKit (\u003e=3.6), and generalizesimilarity. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution that comes with all these modules, except for python-louvain, NetworKit, and generalizedsimilarity, and works on all major modern operating systems.",

It develops statistical methods for the analysis of optical/infrared and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, including wavelet transformations, kernel methods for nonlinear classification, as well as an introduction to deep learning in the context of feed forward neural networks. The material is self-contained and illustrated with many programming examples, all of which can be conveniently run in a web browser. Each chapter concludes with exercises complementing or extending the material in the text. Numerous examples of programming the Google Earth Engine and TensorFlow APIs are given. New in the fourth edition is an in-depth treatment of a recent sequential change detection algorithm for polarimetric SAR image time series. The accompanying software consists of Python (open source) versions of all of the main image analysis algorithms, thus accessible to all readers with a computer and an Internet connection. Features Includes open source software and tools Presents easy, platform-independent software installation methods (Docker containerization) Concepts and algorithms are illustrated in Jupyter notebooks Utilizes freely accessible imagery via the Google Earth Engine Examines deep learning examples including a sound introduction to neural networks Provides many examples of cloud programming (Google Earth Engine API) SAR image time series.
