Overview

This module covers text processing using string methods to search and manipulate strings. This module will also cover how to use regular expressions for searching and validating data. As much data we retrieved from externals sources may come in initially as strings, these topics will be useful for processing, parsing, and validating text-based data in our future data processing activities. String processing is a major activity in data wrangling and organization. 
Learning Objectives
By the end of course, you will be able to:

    CO1: Identify industry-standard approaches to organization, storage, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of big data
    CO2: Wrangle raw data from different sources and formats
    CO3: Write data science programs in Python through an object-oriented approach using common data science packages
    CO4: Analyze data and results through statistical and visual analysis
    CO5: Investigate data science problems involving big data

By the end of this modules, you will be able to:

    MO 3.1 Apply text processing in data wrangling (supports CO1, CO2, CO5)
    MO 3.2 Use string methods to search, manipulate, and create new strings (supports CO2, CO3)
    MO 3.3 Use regular expressions to search and validate text data in Python Programming (supports CO2, CO3)
