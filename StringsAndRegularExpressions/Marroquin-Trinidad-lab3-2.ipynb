    "## Lab 3\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Lab 3 consists of an exercise on string processing with an emphasis in regular expressions. </em>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will write a function that convert any imperial measurements within a sentence to metric. For example, if the original string said ```'This pencil was 2 inches long```, then the function will return ```'This pencil was 5 centimeters long'```. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function ```convertString``` that will convert imperial measurements within a sentence to metric. It takes in one parameter ```sentence``` which is a descriptive sentence with an imperial measurement. It will return the same sentence but with the imperial measurement replaced with the metric equivalent. Use the methods from the RegEx (regular expression) module to modify the string.\n",
    "    - Tip: ```re.compile(r'(\\d+\\.\\d+|\\d+) foot?')``` represents any number in front of \"foot\". Search for that pattern and replace it.\n",
    "    - TIp2: When you have a ```matchobject = re.search(r'(\\d+\\.\\d+|\\d+) inch(?:es)?', sentence)``` you can retrieve the number with ```matchobject.group(1))```\n",
    "    - Convert inches to centimeters, feet and yards to meters, miles to kilometers, and °F to °C (Fahrenheit to Celsius).\n",
    "    - The function needs to also check for singular inputs like \"foot\" and \"inch\" and convert them to the metric units. The metric units can all be plural (meters, centimeters,...)\n",
    "    - Make sure the function can handle multiple values with different conversion factors in one sentence. \n",
    "    - Round the output value\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Write a function which converts Fahrenheit to Clesius. Use that function within the ```convertString``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a functon that searches a text for imparial units and creates a dictionary with the units and the respective metric units. (just the units without the values) Tip: You can use the findall method and create a true/fals statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Produce a table with header line and the converted units from the above task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add function comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Run your functions to test it and leave the outputs in your submitted notebook. Use the test cases provided below."
