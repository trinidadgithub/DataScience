Overview

This module introduces the fundamentals of relational database and document-oriented databases systems. For relational databases, we will learn basic Standard Query Language (SQL) statements to query, retrieve, and manipulate structured information stored in tables in relational databases. Local databases will be setup and managed using sqlite3, which will enable us to write programs in Python in conjuction with SQL to retrieve data we will use for further computation and analysis. Tthis module will also cover document-oriented databases (NoSQL) that store semi-structured data, usually in JSON format. We will write Python programs that will connect to MongoDB, an online NoSQL database. Lastly, we will learn another geospatial visualization library, Folium, to create interactive maps and choropleths to visualize data on maps.
