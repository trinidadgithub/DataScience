Overview

In this module, we will learn about natural language processing of text. In particular, we will study natural language processing of review text regarding analyzing the sentiment and objectivity. For that we will use the TextBlob module. The other topic of this module is machine learning. We are using the scikit-learn module which provides the most important machine learning tools which allow us to analyze data and predict future results.
Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
