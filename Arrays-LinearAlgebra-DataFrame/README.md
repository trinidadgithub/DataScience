Overview

This module is an in-depth investigation into NumPy arrays and their common operations and how othey can be used for basic linear algebra computations involving vectors and matrices. This module will introduce the Pandas DataFrame, which will be used in our larger projects to hold the dataset. We will learn how to use create DataFrames as well as use them to build visualizations. In addition to the topics covered in the readings, we will learn how to transform DataFrame data from wide to long form, access real-time and historic data using the Yahoo Finance Module. Use Seaborn's FacetGrids to create multiple related plots.
