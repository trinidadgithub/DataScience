Assume that the parameter value will always be a whole number. The function returns the factorial of the parameter value. If the function is called with a negative number, return -1. \n",

    "The code generated appears more efficient, and the AI implemented recursion which I should have considered.  Also, the response included some test cases to validate the results, this is very helpful.  The AI generated some output code to show the results, but it wasn't that user-friendly; although I was able to determine the results were correct.  Moreover, the comments weren't as verbose as mine, and it didn't include any information about the function related to inputs or return values.  I think the results were satisfactory but in the end a human could make it more readable and supportable, or guide the AI code generator along the way.  \n",
